This is a beginner course, but I'm starting with the assumption that there's a few things you already know before going through this course. I'm assuming you already know the basics of HTML and CSS and how to work with the file system and have done some basic HTML projects before. If you need help with basic HTML, Check out HTML Essential Training. 

I also expect you to have some experience with CSS. If you're just getting started with CSS, make sure you've taken something like CSS Fundamentals.

Since this is a course on the new features of Bootstrap 4, I'm assuming that you already know how Bootstrap 3 works and have some experience using it. This course was designed for people who want to know what's new and how to migrate existing websites, so if that's not you, then check out some of the other bootstrap courses in the library.

The exercise files for this course, has everything you need to get started or you can use our practice environments to work with the projects in this course.

If you feel comfortable with these requirements, then it's time to get started.
