Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos, senior staff author...

In this course, I'm going to teach you about the new version of Bootstrap...version 4. This course is designed for people who want to know what the new features are or are thinking of migrating an existing site from the old version to the new. 

I'm going to start by giving up a quick summary of the upgrade focusing on what's new and what's changed.

Then we'll work on the new components that are important to learn when switching to this new version of bootstrap including the display properties, and flexbox containers that affect so much of how bootstrap works.

We'll take a look a cards...an important new component with many layout options.


Then, we'll take a look at how migrating a website from the version 3 will need to be tackled. We'll start by looking at some of the options for migrating to the new grid. Then we'll look at some of the major components that are going to be challenging to migrate like the navigation, tables, forms as well as forms and tables.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started.
