If you have access to the exercise files for this course, you can download them to your desktop, as I've done here.

Inside the exercise files folder, you'll find a subfolder with the files for each video with examples to follow. I'll start each video with a copy of this folder on my desktop renamed to bootstrap and that folder opened in my favorite code editor. I'll be using Visual Studio Code for this course. A copy of the index.html will also be opened in my browser.

Like with many of my projects, for more advanced users there is a github repository for this course available at Github. It has the advantage of also having a copy of the files at the end of each video, which you can find at this URL https://github.com/planetoftheweb/bootstrap4. Unfortunately, this version won't include the images, but you'll notice that in the exercise files folder, I've added a folder with all of the images for this project.

If you don't have access to the exercise files, that's okay. You can still follow along by watching how I use the files.

So, letâ€™s get started.
