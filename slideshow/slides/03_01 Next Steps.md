Hey there, it's Ray again. Thanks for watching this course.

I'm really glad you watched this course. I love Bootstrap and there's a lot of good resources you can find right here to take you further with bootstrap, so check the library for more information. I've got big plans for building more bootstrap courses. 

If you're an advanced user, you should also check out the Github project for this course. The repo has a branch for the different videos in the course. I also added a gulp file that will automatically reload your work as you go and even check that your bootstrap code is valid.

If you want to learn more about me, you can reach me at my personal site raybo.org or through twitter, github, linkedin or about any other social media network @planetoftheweb.

Once again thanks for watching this course...and have fun learning.
